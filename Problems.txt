1. Create case classes for schema provided for both datasets (implement with Spark Core)
2. CompanyOrders.csv
3. case class CompanyOrders(OrderID: String, CompanyID: String, CompanyName: String, CompanyLocation: String, ComponentToBeManufactured: String, Quantity: Long, EstimatedCost: Double, OrderDate: String, DueDate: String, CompletionStatus: String, DeliveryStatus: String
4. case class CompanyInfo(CompanyID: String, CompanyName: String, CompanyLocation: String, CompanyAddress: String, CompanyContact: Long, ProfitMargin: Double, EstablishedYear: Int)
5. Load both csv files into CompanyInfoRDD and CompanyOrdersRDD (spark core)
6. Convert both datasets to DFs (Spark SQL)
7. Fetch the details of all the companies that are at least 20 years old (spark sql)
8. Fetch the name of the company which has the highest profit margin among those who have ordered Shock Absorbers (spark core)
9. Find the total number of companies that have ordered Fender (spark core)
10. Find the total number of Exhaust Pipes that have been ordered from North Carolina (spark SQL)
11. Find the total count of all the orders that has been completed but not delivered yet (spark core)
12. Display all the orders whose status is still pending. Reduce the total cost of all such orders by 10%. Store them in a file called DiscountOrders.csv (SparkSQL)
13. Based on the previous question, fetch the total cost to be paid by all the franchises having company name as Laser Wheels (spark core)
